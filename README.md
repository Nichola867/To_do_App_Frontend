## To do App
This To Do App allows you to keep track of your tasks.

## Usage
Write your task into the task bar at the top, select the date to  be assigned to that task, then click the tick to add into the "To Do" section of the app. The task cannot be added unless text has been entered into the 'Write your task here' field.

Once a task has been completed, click the "Task DOne" button to move it into the Completed section of the app, where you can keep it until you are ready to finally delete.

You can of course delete from the "To do" section if you wish.

If a task has been moved into the Completed section and it has not yet been completed, you can click the "Task Not Complete" button to move it back into the "To Do" section.
